            <p><h1>About Me</h1> I'm a postdoctoral fellow at <a href='https://www.unsw.edu.au/' target='_blank'>UNSW Sydney</a>, hosted by Toby Walsh. I'm a member of the ADT group at the School of Computer Science and Engineering. I do research on topics in Computational Social Choice.</p>

            <p>Before coming to Sydney I was a PhD candidate at the University of Amsterdam, supervised by Ulle Endriss. I received my MSc in Logic from the University of Amsterdam in 2016. Even longer before that (in 2014), I graduated from the University of California, Berkeley with a BA in Cognitive Science.</p>

            <p>When I'm not studying formal models of collective decision making, I like to knit and solve crossword puzzles.</p>

                <p><h2>My PhD Dissertation</h2>This thesis examines strategic manipulation in three areas of social choice theory - single-winner voting, multiwinner voting, and judgment aggregation. It is widely accepted that strategyproofness often does not play nice with other axioms. While we would like our aggregation methods to be strategyproof - meaning no agent has an incentive to misreport her preferences or opinions - strategic manipulation is difficult to avoid, no matter what specific framework we consider.</p>

<p>A well-known and often used approach is to consider only specific types of input to the aggregation method - so-called restricted domains. Our approach here is to consider manipulation on profiles that fall within certain restricted domains where existing results tell us manipulation within the domain is not possible. In general we ask whether agents can manipulate from a profile in a ``well-behaved'' domain to one outside the domain in question.</p>

        <h1>Teaching</h1>
     <p>In January 2021 I taught a Master of Logic project on preference extensions. In the fall of 2018 I co-organised a student seminar on algorithmic game theory. In June 2018, I co-organised a Master of Logic research project on judgment aggregation. I've regularly been a teaching assistant for the MoL/AI courses on game theory (2017-2019, 2021) and computational social choice (2017, 2019).</p>

     <p>Since arriving at UNSW, I've supervised two honours thesis students.</p>
