            <p>I'm a postdoctoral fellow at UNSW Sydney, hosted by Toby Walsh. I'm a member of the ADT group at the School of Computer Science and Engineering. I do research on topics in Computational Social Choice. 

                Before coming to Sydney I was a PhD candidate at the University of Amsterdam, supervised by Ulle Endriss. I received my MSc in Logic from the University of Amsterdam in 2016. Even longer before that (in 2014), I graduated from the University of California, Berkeley with a BA in Cognitive Science.

                When I'm not studying formal models of collective decision making, I like to knit and solve crossword puzzles. 

                (This homepage is still a work in progress, if you notice something missing or wrong, I absolutely know about it for sure...but feel free to still let me know.)</p>

     In January 2021 I taught a Master of Logic project on preference extensions. In the fall of 2018 I co-organised a student seminar on algorithmic game theory. In June 2018, I co-organised a Master of Logic research project on judgment aggregation. I've regularly been a teaching assistant for the MoL/AI courses on game theory (2017-2019, 2021) and computational social choice (2017, 2019).</p>
